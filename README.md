My journey into cybersecurity: labs, notes, and tools
## ðŸ§ª Day 1: Networking Fundamentals Lab

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Tools Used:** Ubuntu WSL, ping, ip, ifconfig, netstat  

### ðŸ”§ What I Did:
- Verified internet connection using `ping google.com`
- Found my internal IP address with `ip a` and `ifconfig`
- Installed `net-tools` and explored open ports using `netstat -tuln`

### ðŸ“š What I Learned:
- The 4 layers of the TCP/IP model (Application, Transport, Internet, Network)
- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Basic Linux commands to explore network configuration

### ðŸ§  Reflections:
I understood how computers communicate using IP and ports, and began using real terminal commands to investigate my own machine's connectivity. A great first step in becoming a Security Analyst!
