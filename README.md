My journey into cybersecurity: labs, notes, and tools
# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Iris Gebhart â€” a passionate and motivated cybersecurity student based in the United States. I'm currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate while actively building hands-on experience with Linux, network fundamentals, and security tools.

My goal is to become a remote Security Analyst and grow into more advanced roles in cloud and defensive security. I thrive on solving problems, protecting systems, and continuously learning how the digital world works â€” and how to defend it.

Right now, I'm building this portfolio to document my learning journey and showcase my growing skills through labs, writeups, and practical exercises. Thanks for stopping by!

## ðŸ§ª Day 1: Networking Fundamentals Lab

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Tools Used:** Ubuntu WSL, ping, ip, ifconfig, netstat  

### ðŸ”§ What I Did:
- Verified internet connection using `ping google.com`
- Found my internal IP address with `ip a` and `ifconfig`
- Installed `net-tools` and explored open ports using `netstat -tuln`

### ðŸ“š What I Learned:
- The 4 layers of the TCP/IP model (Application, Transport, Internet, Network)
- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Basic Linux commands to explore network configuration

### ðŸ§  Reflections:
I understood how computers communicate using IP and ports, and began using real terminal commands to investigate my own machine's connectivity. A great first step in becoming a Security Analyst!
